Task 3: Heart Disease Prediction

Objective:
Build a model to predict whether a person is at risk of heart disease based on their health data.

Dataset Used:
UCI Heart Disease Dataset (available on Kaggle), containing features like age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, maximum heart rate, and other medical measurements.

Models Applied:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Key Results and Findings:

Both models achieved good accuracy and ROC-AUC scores in predicting heart disease risk.

Logistic Regression coefficients and Decision Tree feature importances highlighted key predictors such as age, chest pain type, resting ECG, cholesterol, and maximum heart rate.

Confusion matrices and ROC curves helped assess model performance and classification strengths.

Exploratory data analysis revealed trends and correlations among features, providing insights into factors affecting heart disease risk.

Skills Practiced:

Binary classification

Medical data understanding and interpretation

Model evaluation using ROC-AUC and confusion matrix
